## Critical Functionality Gaps

### üî¥ High Priority Gaps
1. **No Streaming Support** - Critical for real-time applications
2. **No Agent Updates/Deletion** - Can't modify agents after creation
3. **No History/Usage Tracking** - Can't monitor costs or usage
4. **No Voice Editing/Deletion** - Voices are permanent once created

### üü° Medium Priority Gaps
1. **No Project Management** - Can't organize work
2. **No Workspace Features** - No team collaboration
3. **Limited Knowledge Base** - Can only add, not manage documents
4. **No Batch Processing** - Can't handle multiple operations efficiently

### üü¢ Low Priority Gaps
1. **No Pronunciation Dictionaries** - Advanced feature
2. **No Dubbing** - Specialized use case
3. **No Audio Native** - Specialized feature

## Recommendations

### For MCP Server Users

**Use the MCP Server when:**
- You need basic TTS, voice cloning, or transcription
- Working with conversational AI agents (basic operations)
- Simple voice discovery and selection
- Quick prototyping without streaming needs

**Use Direct API when:**
- You need streaming for real-time applications
- Managing agent lifecycle (updates, deletions)
- Tracking usage and costs
- Working with teams (workspace features)
- Need advanced audio features (dubbing, timestamps)
- Managing projects or complex workflows

### For ElevenLabs Team

**Priority 1 - Essential Additions:**
1. Add streaming endpoints (at least basic TTS streaming)
2. Add agent update and delete operations
3. Add basic usage/history tracking
4. Add voice management (edit/delete)

**Priority 2 - Important Additions:**
1. Complete knowledge base CRUD operations
2. Add project management basics
3. Add conversation audio retrieval
4. Add batch operations support

**Priority 3 - Nice to Have:**
1. Workspace management
2. Pronunciation dictionaries
3. Advanced audio features (dubbing)
4. Complete phone number management

## Workarounds for Missing Features

### Streaming Audio
- Use direct API calls with `requests` or `httpx`
- Implement custom WebSocket handler
- Use the official SDK directly for these operations

### Agent Management
```python
# Direct API call for updating agent
import requests
response = requests.patch(
    f"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/agents/{agent_id}",
    headers={"xi-api-key": api_key},
    json=update_data
)
```

### Usage Tracking
```python
# Direct API call for usage stats
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/usage/character-stats",
    headers={"xi-api-key": api_key}
)
```

## Coverage Statistics

- **Total API Endpoints:** 66
- **MCP Implemented:** 22
- **Coverage Percentage:** 33.3%
- **Categories with 100% coverage:** 3 (Voice Library, Voice Design, Models)
- **Categories with 0% coverage:** 3 (Projects, Pronunciation, Workspace)
- **Partially covered categories:** 10

## Conclusion

The ElevenLabs MCP server provides good coverage of core functionality but lacks many management, streaming, and advanced features. For production applications requiring full API capabilities, direct API integration or using the official SDK alongside the MCP server is recommended.

The MCP server is best suited for:
- Rapid prototyping
- Simple audio generation tasks
- Basic conversational AI setup
- Development environments where streaming isn't critical

For enterprise or production use cases, consider implementing a hybrid approach using the MCP server for supported operations and direct API calls for missing functionality.
