# Archive Directory

This directory contains development artifacts and historical files from the ElevenLabs MCP server project.

## Contents

### Development Context (`context/`)
- **elevenlabs-agents-mcp-reference.md**: Original agents server reference
- **elevenlabs-api-endpoints-reference.md**: API endpoint documentation
- **elevenlabs-context-library/**: Comprehensive development guides and templates
- **elevenlabs-knowledge-mcp-reference.md**: Original knowledge server reference
- **elevenlabs-mcp-gap-analysis.md**: Initial feature gap analysis
- **elevenlabs-prompt-guide/**: Extensive prompt engineering documentation

### Legacy Server Implementations
- **elevenlabs-conversations/**: Early conversation-focused server (deprecated)
- **elevenlabs-integrations/**: Integration server attempt (removed due to API limitations)

### Development Notes
- **scratchpad*.md**: Development scratchpad files with implementation notes

## Why These Were Archived

1. **Context Directory**: Contains extensive development research and guides that were useful during initial development but are no longer needed for daily operations.

2. **Legacy Servers**: 
   - `elevenlabs-conversations`: Functionality merged into `elevenlabs-knowledge`
   - `elevenlabs-integrations`: Removed due to non-existent API endpoints

3. **Scratchpad Files**: Development notes that served their purpose during implementation.

## Current Active Servers

The project now focuses on three production-ready servers:
- `elevenlabs-agents/`: Agent management and configuration
- `elevenlabs-knowledge/`: Knowledge base and conversation analytics  
- `elevenlabs-testing/`: Agent testing and simulation

## Accessing Archived Content

These files remain available for reference but are no longer part of the active development workflow. The comprehensive guides in `elevenlabs-context-library/` and `elevenlabs-prompt-guide/` contain valuable information for advanced ElevenLabs implementations.
