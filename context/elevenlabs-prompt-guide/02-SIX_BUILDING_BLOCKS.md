# The Six Building Blocks Framework for ElevenLabs System Prompts

## Overview

The Six Building Blocks Framework is the foundational structure for creating effective, consistent, and maintainable ElevenLabs AI agents. This framework ensures your agents behave predictably while maintaining natural, engaging conversations.

## Why This Framework Matters

Without structure, system prompts become:
- **Contradictory**: Instructions conflict with each other
- **Unpredictable**: Agent behavior varies wildly
- **Unmaintainable**: Difficult to debug and improve
- **Ineffective**: Fail to achieve business objectives

The Six Building Blocks provide:
- **Clarity**: Each section has a specific purpose
- **Consistency**: Predictable agent behavior
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update and refine
- **Effectiveness**: Clear path to achieving goals

```markdown
PRIMARY: Diagnose the customer's plumbing issue and either provide 
a solution they can implement themselves or schedule a service visit.
```

#### Secondary Goal
Fallback when primary isn't achievable:
```markdown
SECONDARY: If unable to diagnose or the issue requires professional service, 
collect contact information and problem details for a callback within 2 hours.
```

#### Tertiary Goal
Final fallback or escalation:
```markdown
TERTIARY: If the situation is an emergency (flooding, gas leak), 
immediately provide safety instructions and transfer to emergency hotline.
```

### Goal Types by Agent Function

**Router/Receptionist Goals:**
```markdown
## GOAL
PRIMARY: Identify the caller's need within 30 seconds and route to the 
appropriate specialist or department.
SECONDARY: If routing isn't clear, gather more information through 
targeted questions.
TERTIARY: If still unclear, collect contact details for a callback 
from a human representative.
```

**Sales Agent Goals:**
```markdown
## GOAL
PRIMARY: Qualify the lead, identify their pain points, and demonstrate 
how our solution addresses their specific needs.
SECONDARY: If not ready to purchase, schedule a detailed demo or 
follow-up call with a senior sales representative.

doesn't fit and thank them for their time.
```

**Support Agent Goals:**
```markdown
## GOAL
PRIMARY: Resolve the customer's technical issue using the knowledge base 
and troubleshooting guides.
SECONDARY: If issue cannot be resolved, create a detailed ticket with 
all diagnostic information for escalation to Level 2 support.
TERTIARY: If customer becomes frustrated, acknowledge their frustration 
and offer immediate callback from a senior technician.
```

### Measuring Goal Achievement
Include metrics in your goals:
- Time targets: "within 2 minutes"
- Success criteria: "with 95% accuracy"
- Quality standards: "maintaining professional tone"

## 3. ENVIRONMENT - Context & Channel

### Purpose
Provides WHERE and HOW the interaction occurs, allowing the agent to adapt its behavior to the communication medium.

### Channel-Specific Considerations

**Phone Call Environment:**
```markdown
## ENVIRONMENT
This is a phone call. The caller may be:
- In a noisy environment (traffic, workplace, home with children)
- Using a mobile device with potential connection issues
- Unable to see visual information or links
- Potentially multitasking or driving
Business hours are 8 AM to 6 PM AEST, Monday to Friday.
After-hours calls should be noted for callback next business day.
```

**Web Chat Environment:**
```markdown
## ENVIRONMENT
This is a web chat widget on our website. The user:
- Can see and click links you provide
- May be browsing multiple tabs simultaneously
- Expects quick, concise responses
- Can copy/paste information easily
- May abandon chat if responses are slow
Average response time expectation is under 30 seconds.
```

**Video Call Environment:**
```markdown
## ENVIRONMENT
This is a video consultation. The user:
- Can show you visual problems or documents
- Expects a more personal, face-to-face experience
- May have bandwidth limitations affecting quality
- Values non-verbal communication cues
Sessions are typically scheduled for 15-30 minutes.
```

## 4. CONTEXT - System Variables & Dynamic Information

### Purpose
Integrates real-time data and system information into the conversation.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Double Underscore Rule

**Always use double underscore for system variables:**
- ✅ CORRECT: `{{system__time}}`
- ❌ WRONG: `{{system_time}}`

### Standard Context Block

```markdown
## CONTEXT
- Current local time: {{system__time}} ({{system__timezone}})
- Current UTC time: {{system__time_utc}}
- Caller ID (if available): {{system__caller_id}}
- Conversation ID: {{system__conversation_id}}
- Agent ID: {{system__agent_id}}
```

### Available System Variables

| Variable | Description | Example Output |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `{{system__time}}` | Local time in caller's timezone | "2:30 PM" |
| `{{system__timezone}}` | Caller's timezone | "Australia/Sydney" |
| `{{system__time_utc}}` | Current UTC time | "2024-01-15T04:30:00Z" |
| `{{system__caller_id}}` | Phone number if available | "+61412345678" |
| `{{system__conversation_id}}` | Unique conversation ID | "conv_abc123xyz" |
| `{{system__agent_id}}` | Current agent's ID | "agent_7701k2pr..." |

### Using Context for Business Logic

**Time-Based Routing:**
```markdown
## CONTEXT
- Current time: {{system__time}} ({{system__timezone}})
- Business hours: 8 AM - 6 PM Monday-Friday
- After-hours support: Emergency only

## ADAPTABILITY
If current time is outside business hours:
- Inform: "You've reached us after hours."
- Offer: Emergency service (additional charges apply)
- Alternative: Schedule callback for next business day
```

**Caller Recognition:**
```markdown
## CONTEXT
- Caller ID: {{system__caller_id}}
- Check if existing customer based on phone number
- Previous interaction history available in CRM

## ADAPTABILITY
If caller_id is recognized:
- Greet by name if available
- Reference previous interactions
- Skip basic verification questions
```

### Emotional Intelligence

```markdown
## ADAPTABILITY

If user sounds frustrated or angry:
- Immediately acknowledge: "I can hear you're frustrated, and I completely understand why."
- Slow down speech pace
- Offer quicker escalation paths
- Be more concise in responses

If user sounds confused:
- Simplify language
- Break down information into smaller steps
- Offer to repeat or rephrase
- Check understanding more frequently: "Are you with me so far?"

If user is in a hurry:
- Skip pleasantries
- Get straight to solutions
- Offer fastest resolution path
- Acknowledge time pressure: "I know you're in a hurry, let's get straight to it."
```

### Conversation Style Matching

```markdown
## ADAPTABILITY

If user is chatty and conversational:
- Match their conversational style
- Add appropriate small talk
- Be more relaxed in tone

If user is brief and business-like:
- Mirror their conciseness
- Skip elaborate explanations
- Focus on facts and outcomes
- Avoid unnecessary conversation
```

### Technical Level Adjustment

```markdown
## ADAPTABILITY

If user demonstrates technical knowledge:
- Use appropriate technical terms
- Skip basic explanations
- Provide detailed technical information
- Reference specific technologies/protocols

If user is non-technical:
- Use simple analogies
- Avoid all jargon
- Explain step-by-step
- Provide visual descriptions when helpful
```

### Urgency-Based Adaptation

```markdown
## ADAPTABILITY

If user mentions emergency keywords (flood, fire, injury, gas leak):
- Immediately prioritize safety
- Skip all standard procedures
- Provide emergency instructions first
- Transfer to emergency services
- Stay on line until help arrives

If user indicates high business impact:
- Acknowledge the severity
- Expedite to senior support
- Provide immediate workarounds if available
- Offer direct contact for updates
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Order Matters
Always structure in this order: PERSONA → GOAL → ENVIRONMENT → CONTEXT → TONE → ADAPTABILITY

### 2. Be Specific
Vague instructions lead to inconsistent behavior. Be explicit about expectations.

### 3. Test Each Block
Test changes to individual blocks to understand their impact.

### 4. Keep It Focused
Each block should only contain relevant information for its purpose.

### 5. Regular Reviews
Review and refine based on actual conversation transcripts.

### 6. Version Control
Track changes to prompts over time to understand what works.

---

## Common Integration Patterns

### With Multi-Agent Systems
Each agent needs all six blocks, but they can reference shared context.

### With Knowledge Bases
Reference knowledge base in GOAL and ADAPTABILITY sections.

### With Tools and Webhooks
Mention available tools in ENVIRONMENT or CONTEXT.

### With Transfer Rules
Define transfer triggers in ADAPTABILITY section.
