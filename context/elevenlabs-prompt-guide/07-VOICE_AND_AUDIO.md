# Voice and Audio Configuration Guide for ElevenLabs Agents

## Overview

Voice selection and audio configuration are critical for creating believable, engaging AI agents. The right voice with proper settings can make the difference between a robotic interaction and a natural conversation.

## Voice Selection Strategy

### Understanding Voice Types

#### Pre-made Voices
**Best for:** Quick deployment, consistent quality, proven performance

| Voice Category | Use Cases | Characteristics |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Professional** | Business, support, sales | Clear, neutral accent, authoritative |
| **Friendly** | Customer service, hospitality | Warm, approachable, patient |
| **Energetic** | Entertainment, marketing | Upbeat, enthusiastic, engaging |
| **Calm** | Healthcare, meditation, crisis | Soothing, measured, reassuring |
| **Technical** | IT support, tutorials | Precise, clear, methodical |

#### Voice Cloning
**Best for:** Brand consistency, specific requirements, unique identity

```yaml
Cloning Options:
  Instant Clone:
    - 1-3 minutes of audio
    - Good quality
    - Quick setup
    
  Professional Clone:
    - 30+ minutes of audio
