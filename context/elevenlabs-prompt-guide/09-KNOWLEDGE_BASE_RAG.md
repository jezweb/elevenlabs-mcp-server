# Knowledge Base and RAG Configuration for ElevenLabs Agents

## Overview

Knowledge bases with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enable your agents to access and intelligently search through large amounts of information, providing accurate, contextual responses based on your organization's documentation.

## Understanding RAG

### What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines:
1. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from documents
2. **Augmentation**: Enhancing the LLM's knowledge with retrieved content
3. **Generation**: Creating natural responses using the found information

    A[User Query] --> B[RAG System]
    B --> C[Search Documents]
    C --> D[Retrieve Relevant Chunks]
    D --> E[Augment LLM Context]
    E --> F[Generate Response]
    F --> G[Natural Answer]
```

### Benefits of RAG

- **Accuracy**: Responses based on actual documentation
- **Currency**: Easy to update without retraining
- **Specificity**: Organization-specific information
- **Traceability**: Can cite sources
- **Cost-effective**: No model fine-tuning needed

## Knowledge Base Setup

### Supported File Formats

| Format | Best For | Limitations | Max Size |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **PDF** | Manuals, guides, reports | May lose formatting | 50MB |
| **DOCX** | Documents, procedures | Complex layouts may break | 25MB |
| **TXT** | Simple text, logs, FAQs | No formatting | 10MB |
| **HTML** | Web content, help articles | JavaScript not executed | 10MB |
| **EPUB** | Books, long-form content | Limited support | 25MB |

### File Preparation Best Practices

#### 1. Document Structure

```markdown
## GOOD DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

# Clear Main Heading
## Logical Section Headers
### Subsection with Specific Topic

- Bullet points for lists
- Clear, concise information
- One topic per section

**Important:** Key information highlighted
*Note:* Additional context in italics

## BAD DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

Everything in one paragraph with no structure making
it hard for RAG to identify relevant chunks and the
information becomes difficult to retrieve accurately
when users ask specific questions about topics that
are buried in long blocks of text.
```

#### 2. Content Optimization

```markdown
## OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST

### Before Upload

- May include irrelevant info

Use for: Policies, detailed guides
```

#### 2. Retrieval Strategies

```yaml
retrieval_strategies:
  semantic_search:
    description: "Find conceptually similar content"
    use_for: "General questions, concepts"
    example: "What's your return policy?" → Finds return-related content
    
  keyword_matching:
    description: "Exact term matching"
    use_for: "Product names, codes, specific terms"
    example: "Model XR-1000" → Finds exact model references
    
  hybrid_approach:
    description: "Combines semantic and keyword"
    use_for: "Best overall performance"
    configuration:
      semantic_weight: 0.7
      keyword_weight: 0.3
```

### Prompt Integration with RAG

```markdown
## PERSONA
You are Sarah, a Customer Service Agent with access to comprehensive 
company documentation through the knowledge base.

## GOAL
PRIMARY: Answer customer questions accurately using the knowledge base.
SECONDARY: If information isn't in knowledge base, acknowledge and escalate.

## CONTEXT
- Knowledge base contains: Products, policies, procedures, FAQs
- Last updated: Daily
- RAG enabled for intelligent search

## ADAPTABILITY
When searching knowledge base:
1. Parse customer question for key terms
2. Search knowledge base
3. If found with high confidence (>0.8):
   - Provide accurate answer
   - Cite the source document
   - Ask if they need more detail
4. If found with medium confidence (0.5-0.8):
   - Provide answer with caveat
   - Offer to verify with specialist
5. If not found or low confidence (<0.5):
   - Acknowledge limitation
   - Offer alternatives
   - Collect question for knowledge base update

Example responses:
HIGH CONFIDENCE: "According to our Product Guide, the XR-1000 
has a 5-year warranty covering parts and labor."

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE: "Based on our documentation, it appears 
this might be covered under warranty, but let me connect 
you with a specialist to confirm."

LOW/NO CONFIDENCE: "I don't have specific information about 
that in my current documentation. Let me connect you with 
someone who can provide accurate details."
```

## Advanced RAG Techniques

### 1. Multi-Document Synthesis

```markdown
## HANDLING MULTIPLE SOURCES

When RAG returns multiple relevant documents:

1. **Prioritize by Recency**
   - Check document dates
   - Use most recent for policies
   - Note if information conflicts

2. **Combine Complementary Info**
   - Product specs from catalog
   - Pricing from price list
   - Warranty from policy doc

3. **Handle Conflicts**
   - If documents conflict, acknowledge
   - Escalate for clarification
   - Don't guess or average

Example Response:
"I found information in multiple documents. According to 
our Product Catalog (updated January 2024), the warranty 
is 5 years. Our Warranty Policy (updated February 2024) 
confirms this and adds that it covers parts and labor."
```

### 2. Query Expansion

```markdown
## IMPROVING SEARCH WITH QUERY EXPANSION

Original Query: "broken"

Expanded Search Terms:
- broken
- not working
- malfunction
- defective
- damaged
- faulty
- issue
- problem

Implementation in Prompt:
"When customer uses vague terms, expand search:
- 'broken' → search for troubleshooting, repairs, warranty
- 'cost' → search for pricing, fees, charges
- 'help' → search for support, guide, manual"
```

### 3. Contextual RAG

```yaml
contextual_rag:
  conversation_context:
    - Previous questions in session
    - Customer type (new/existing)
    - Product mentioned earlier
    
  search_modification:
    - If discussing product X, prioritize X documents
    - If previous question about pricing, weight pricing docs
    - If frustrated customer, prioritize quick solutions
    
  example:
    question_1: "Tell me about the XR-1000"
    rag_search_1: "XR-1000 specifications features"
    
    question_2: "What's the warranty?"
    rag_search_2: "XR-1000 warranty" # Includes context
```
