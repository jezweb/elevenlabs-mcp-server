## Implementation Notes

1. **File Organization**
   - Keep each resource file under 500 lines for maintainability
   - Use consistent JSON structure across all files
   - Include descriptions for all templates

2. **Versioning**
   - Add version field to each resource file
   - Track changes in CHANGELOG
   - Maintain backward compatibility

3. **Validation**
   - Validate all JSON on load
   - Provide defaults for missing fields
   - Log warnings for deprecated fields

4. **Documentation**
   - Update README with new templates
   - Create usage examples for each template
   - Document customization options

5. **Testing**
   - Test each template with real API
   - Verify voice configurations work
   - Check all escalation paths
